        2024 has been a year. Nearly half of the world's population were able to
        vote in their national election. We saw another year of record-breaking

        election. Ukraine has continued to fight against Russian attacks. AI has
        continued to transform most of the things we thought were possible. The
        internet became obsessed with Luigi Mangione. And the 2024 Olympics were
        held in Paris.

        the Middle East, the conflict between Israel and Palestine continued.
